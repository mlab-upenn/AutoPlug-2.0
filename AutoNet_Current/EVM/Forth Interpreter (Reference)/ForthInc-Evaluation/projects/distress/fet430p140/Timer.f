TIMER A

Copyright (C) 2002  FORTH, Inc.

Timer A provides the interrupt-driven millisecond timer for the
Distress application.  This version of MS supplies service to a single
task only and allows the CPU to enter low-power mode during the
delay interval.

TARGET

{ ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Timing

MS specifies a delay of u milliseconds.  Sets the delay value
in #DLY and the task's STATUS address in 'DLY then suspends the task.
The <DELAY> interrupt compares the timer with the system millisecond
count in MSECS and awakens the task when the timeout is reached.
